# MemoryCard
 An engine that allows you to create tests for educational institutions. Student statistics available!
You can add questions in program code and then give it to someone.


Edit questions like this:
```
question_list = []
question_list.append(
    Question('Official language of Brazil?', 'Portuguese', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Brazilian'))
question_list.append(
    Question('Which color is NOT on Russian flag?', 'Green', 'Red', 'White', 'Blue'))
question_list.append(
    Question('National yakut hut?', 'Urasa', 'Urt', 'Igloo', 'Hata'))
```
You just need to write a new question in the first argument, the correct answer in the second, and then all the other answers.

Edited question will look like this:
```
question_list.append(
 Question('Which language does NOT exist?', 'Newspeak', 'Zulu', 'Romani', 'Betawi'))
```
***Enjoy your use!***
